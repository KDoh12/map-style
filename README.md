# Mari-Time Zones

This repo contains an [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project folder which contains a web map using a style I have taken from [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) and modified slightly to include time zones and port locations. View the web map [here!](https://contig.us/kdoh12/mari-time-zones/)
